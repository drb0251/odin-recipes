	<h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my first Odin Project website! This is just a simple recipe website with 3 recipes linked within separate html files. I've organised it according to the best practices I'm learning and commit when meaningful code changes are made.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="recipes/steak.html">Steak with asparagus, potatoes and a nice red wine!</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/burger.html">Burger, fries and your favourite tap beer!</a></li>
    <li><a href="recipes/fettuccine.html">Fettucine Alfredo, with your favourite white wine!</a></li>
  </ul>
